we use pipe |  to use multiple commands and the output of first will be given as input to second

  ex:  echo " welcome "  |  tr a-z  A-Z

wc -c   ----->  count characters    
wc -l   ----->  count no of lines 
wc -w   ----->  count no of words 


for x in vimal  eric tom pop harry 
>  do
> echo $x
> echo "hello hi "
> done 


In shell scripting instead {}  we use  do at start and done at end 

for x in { 0...6 }  ; do  echo $x  : done 

echo ~expr  5-1 ~    --> gives 4 

echo "vimal: x:h1:111:ok"  | cut -d : -f1
echo "vimal:x:h1:111:ok"  |  cut -d : -f3,4

id kanna  ->  checks does user kanna exists or not 

for i in ~cat /etc/passwd~
> do
> echo $i
> done


cat /etc/passwd  | cut -d : -f1

grep -v linux lw.txt  -> print all lines not having linux 
grep -v linux lw.txt  and lly -n  to count 

cat /etc/passwd   |  grep bash  |  cut -d : -f1
grep bash$  /etc/passwd 


to create  a function   in shell scripting 

  vim f.sh 

    lw() {
      
            date 
            cal
        }
     lw

  bash f.sh


  kanna()  {

        name : $1
        echo " im $name "
          
            }

     kanna

    bash  f.sh  eshwar


    myuser()  {

        cat /etc/passwd    |  grep   ${1}$   |  cut -d1   : -f1  ;
        
        myuser  no-login
    
    bash  f.sh


  mynettest()   {

      ping  -c  1  www.google.com   &>  /dev/null
      [ $? == 0 ] && echo " connected "  ||  echo "error " 
      
                }
     mynettest

  bash f.sh


when we run a command if its  existing then print output  on screen else it returns to a file to store  output of error  command 

    ex:  date1    &>  n.txt  
          echo n.txt


>   --->  this operation overwrite the file info
>>  --->  this operation will append the file info

&>>  --->  append error command output info into a file 


when we want to use the function of a file we should load the file by 
        .<filename>     ex :   .file.sh
 
          
  But when we logout and login again we should load function and file but to automate the loading of file we add it in bashrc 
          
          vim  .bashrc 
              ./root/f.sh
          
   in the shell 
          salary=3
          
  if [ $salary   -ge  5 ]
          > then 
          > echo "ok"
          > else
          > echo "not"
          > fi
          
     fi is the closing syntax for if 
          
      the above script gives output  as   not  
          
      change salary=7   and run the script it prints   ok 
          
          
          
          
      script of installing  a software by mentioning  name  and only if not exist 

vim  /tmp/p.sh
          
    MYUID=$(id-u)      
       if  [ $MYUID   -eq  0 ]
          
       then 
          echo " we can do "
          read -p  " enter ur package "  pack
          if rpm  -q  $pack  &>  /dev/null
          
          then 
          
                tput setaf 6
          
                echo "$pack  already  installed "
                tput setaf  7
          
          elif  yum install  $pack  -y  &>  /dev/null
          
          then
              echo " $pack installed successfully "
              tput setaf  7
          
          fi
          
     else 
              echo  " not allowed to install  packages "
          
     fi
          
          
     
          
 bash  /tmp/p.sh
          
          
   yum install  epel-release in rhel8
          
   amazon-linux-extras   install  epel  in  AMI
          
   yum install   Shellcheck   -y
          
   
              vim  lw.sh 
          
                  x=5
                  echo $x
          
              bash lw.sh
          
          
     shellcheck  lw.sh   -  this will check the code interpreter and the shell using
          
          
         we can able to run the file  only from its path  where it is located   to know the path run command   which <command>
          
                ex :   which date   -  gives the path of date where it is located
                  
                        echo  $PATH  -  gives all the default path's 
          
          to run the script from any folder we should copy the file to  /usr/local/bin
          
          
          but to run the file as command instead      bash  <file>        we should make the file executable   using 
          
                  chmod +x  <file>     ex:   chmod  +x  lw.sh
          
          then we can run lw.sh instead bash  lw.sh 
          
          
     In a script to tell the interpreter that this script  is of bash we write     #!/usr/bin/bash
          
          
          echo " linux  >] $ world "   ->  it fails 
          echo " linux  >] $ world '   ->   prints  as it written 
          
          
      we use ''  instead " "  to print statement as it is  lly   \n  for  new line    \t    for  tab space 
          
          
          echo -e  " linux  \033[40m  world "  ->  creates blackbox 
          echo -e -n " \033[40m \033 [47m \033[40m "   ->  creates black white block box
