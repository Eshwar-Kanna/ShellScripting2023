unset is a command used to  remove the value that set to any variable 

x=pop

echo "iam kanna hello $x"   -  here it prints the value of x 

x=7  
echo " iam kanna  ${x}th  standard  

to store the output of any command in a variable 
      var = $(command)
      ex :  y=$(date)   or  t=~date~
      
      
      
read -p "enter your name "  n 
      -  it prompt & store the input in n 
      
      
test command used for comparison operations 

    test  5  -eq  6   ,   test   7  -ge  6    lly   -le  ,  -ne 
    
    
 we can write  multiple commands instantly by separating each with ;
 
    ex:    date ; cal ; ls   -  here the output of one doesnot effect the other 
    
            date && cal   -  here cal runs only if the date runs without failure
            date || cal   -  here cal runs even if the date fails 
            
            
  test  $?  -eq  0  &&   echo "done ok"  ||   echo "errors"   -----------    ternary operation
  
  
  in the same way we can test a file and create only if not exist
  
  to run a script file we use 
  
        bash <file>
        
        
     in read command -n is used to set the  no.of character  limit  to input
     
     
     from ec2-user
     
          cat /etc/shadow    -   doesnot allow to access
          
     from root it provide access 
     
     test -r /etc/shadow  && echo "go a head " || echo " not allowed "   -  try this command from ec2 user and root 
     
     to set a default value for a variable we use 
     
          x=${myname: -kanna}   ---  in  a script file    and when we run the file it prompt for input if no value given it takes default and any iput it taked the input value
          
          x=${myname: +kanna}   ---  here the empty remains empty and if any value given it overwrite with kanna it consider only kanna as input
          
          
          echo ${y,}  ---  first letter of data in y  changes its case  ie.  U->L  ,  L-> U
          echo ${y,,} ---  complete word converts to lowercase
          echo ${x%.*} -- removes everything after the .
          
          
          let z=kanna
          
          echo ${z%n%a}   ----- kan
          echo ${z%a}ss  ------- kannss
          
          echo ${y%:*/*/}   --  removes everything after two /'s from :
          
          
          
      to know the precreated variables we use   see | less    (or)   env    commands 
      
      echo  $SHELL  ,    echo  $SHELL_VERSION
      
      echo {1..5} -----> 12345
      touch a{1....10}.txt  -----> creates files   a1.txt,a2.txt ...... 10.txt   
      echo {10..0}   ->  10 9 8 7 .... 0 
      echo {10..0..2}   ->  10 8 6 ..0
      
      
      p=$(pwd)/hello.html
      
      echo ${p%/*}  - suffix it consider the value from end to start
      echo ${p%#/*}  - prefix  it consider the value from start to end 
      
      t="a1/b1/c1/d1/hi.txt"
      
      echo ${t%/*}  -  a1/b1/c1/d1
      
      echo ${t%%/*}  -> a1
      echo ${t##/*} ->a1/b1/c1/d1
      echo ${#t}  -> count the characters of the retrived word
      
      a=(vimal tom pop  kanna)
      echo $a
      echo ${a[o]}  , echo ${a[3]}
      
      echo ${a[@]}  -> print all data
      echo ${#a[@]}  count all data
      
      
      
      vim name.sh
            
            name = $1
            age = $2
            echo "name is $name  with age $age"
            
       bash name.sh  kanna 18
       
       we can use   $#  in the statement to count the no.of arguments given 
       
       mkdir will not create a directory inside a directory at instant but to create we use -p 
       
          mkdir -p a1/b1/c1/d1
